# Contributing

DQN Zoo is intended to be a mostly static release similar to the original
[Lua DQN code](http://github.com/deepmind/dqn) and as such we are generally not
looking for external contributions.

Please do open issues if you encounter problems as we intend to keep the code
running and fix bugs, but large changes should be infrequent. We do not expect
to add features to existing agents.

If you are keen to suggest a change, please open an issue to discuss. In the
case we agree to incorporate your suggestion, we prefer to implement the change
ourselves as we will need to validate it internally and verify learning
performance of the agents is unaltered.
